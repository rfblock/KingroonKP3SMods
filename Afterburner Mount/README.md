# Modified Voron Afterburner Mount for the Kingroon KP3S

For this mod you can re-use the pancake stepper motor that comes with the KP3S. For the most up to date Afterburner STL files check the [Voron repo](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Afterburner). In addition to the mount file you will need the sensor mount from the original creator [hongsoon](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4766859/files). I recommend adding an ABL probe such as a BL-Touch sensor. After installing the afterburner toolhead the Z-axis limit switch will not be triggered by adjustable screw because it is not long enough.

You can choose to use a beta version of stealthburner or a [moded fan housing](https://github.com/Greg191134/Voron/blob/master/Afterburner%20Optimisation/5015%20fan%20mod/README.md). Note you will need to trim and cut the 5015 fan to use it in this mod                                                                  |
